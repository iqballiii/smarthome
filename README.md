# smarthome_ide
A simple arduino project. This project is a beginner's guide to making a smart home. I have been working around combining flutter and arduino to give a complete control of what you can make rather than using a third party application. 

This is a personal-use case project that I have develpoed using flutter. This application has been integrated with firebase database package to access firebase realtime DB, to control a light bulb using an ESP module. The esp module code can be found on this link ___________. Along with that the appplication's UI is of neumorphism style. I have just started to explore neumorphism style with this applcation. Stay tuned for more...

All that is related to the front-end part. Now, coming to the backend and the hardware used:

ESP 8266 module
- A 5v relay module
- Arduino uno (as an intermediary for connecting the ESP module)
- Light bulb
- Power source
