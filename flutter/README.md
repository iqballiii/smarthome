# smart_switch
This is a personal-use case project that I have develpoed using flutter. This application has been integrated with firebase database package to access firebase realtime DB, to control a light bulb using an ESP module. The esp module code can be found on this link ___________. Along with that the appplication's UI is of neumorphism style. I have just started to explore neumorphism style with this applcation. Stay tuned for more...

All that is related to the front-end part. Now, coming to the backend and the hardware used:
1) ESP 8266 module
2) A 5v relay module
3) arduino uno (as an intermediary for connecting the ESP module)
4) Light bulb
5) Power source
